Given the project “Architecture Test”, this project was refactored taking into consideration the following key points:

- KISS principle 
- decoupling data and representation
- composition over inheritance
- single responsibility principle
- application of design patterns where possible

The project intended to prioritise, in order of importance (high to low):

- complexity of the code (is the code simple to understand?)
- readability of the code (is the code easy to read?)
- robustness (how hard is it to make the app crash?)
- flexibility (how well the game adapts to different devices/screen sizes)
- gameplay polish (is the gameplay behaving in a nice way?)

The project has been designed with a 9:16 ratio in portrait mode, using Unity 2018 LTS version, but should adapt to different aspect ratios.
